# Forbidden Island World
## By Kyle Into

You awaken alone, marooned on an island. You cannot recall how you got here, but desperately want to get back home. Around you are scattered pieces of machinery, which you suspect are important somehow. Looking up to the peak of the island, you see a somewhat ruined helicopter. How convenient that you are a trained pilot Ќ and mechanic! You notice that the tide is rushing in: soon, the island will be flooded and the helicopter will be underwater. Can you collect all the pieces of the helicopter and fly away before itњs too late?
